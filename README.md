# Weather App

I wanted to build a weather app that doesn't use your loaction, only user inputs.
This project was a lot of fun to build and I learned a lot while doing so.
The only dependency is AccuWeather API to get the data.

This project is completely open source so you can check for yourself that there is no location tracking. Enjoy!
